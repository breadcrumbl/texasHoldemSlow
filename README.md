So far:
Input 7 poker cards via command line (e.g. ./main AS KD TC 5D ...) and the program will return the best Texas Hold'em poker hand you can make

Plans:
Calculate pot equity after flop, turn and river

CL compilation shortcut:
g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp cards.cpp -o main
Example run:  ./main  TSh JSh QS KS AS 2C 7D
